Welcome, Space Cadet!

This is HOMEBOUND, a text-based RPG where you play as an intergalactic explorer who awakens
in the foreign land of Zeron, and where your goal is to find your way back home to Earth.

Interact with the locals, explore this unknown world, and collect all of the parts you need
to open a portal back to your home planet.

Once you've returned to Earth, you will recieve a filled out Adventurer's Log containing details of your adventures.

Happy adventuring, Space Cadet, and good luck!
