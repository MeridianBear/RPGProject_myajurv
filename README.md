# HOMEBOUND - Text-Based RPG

Welcome, Space Cadet!

This is HOMEBOUND, a text-based RPG where you play as an intergalactic explorer who awakens
in the foreign land of Zeron, and where your goal is to find your way back home to Earth.

Interact with the locals, explore this unknown world, and collect all of the parts you need
to open a portal back to your home planet.

Happy adventuring, Space Cadet, and good luck!

DISCLAIMER: If you're a little silly goose who wants to type stuff they shouldn't when they're prompted for input, get back to your lame little pond. This game is for people who follow directions. <3
